# 📊 LinkedIn Job Posting Analysis (EDA + Skill Demand Forecasting)

This project analyzes **7,900+ LinkedIn job postings** to uncover hiring trends, high-demand roles, competitive companies, and future skill demand.  
Using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn), the project includes exploratory data analysis, skill extraction, and a simple linear regression model to forecast rising skills.

## 📌 Project Highlights

### **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyzed **7,900+ job postings** to identify:
  - Top hiring cities  
  - Most in-demand job roles  
  - Most active hiring companies  
  - Competitive positions (roles receiving high applications)  
  - Work type distribution (Remote / On-site / Hybrid)
- Extracted and ranked common skills from job descriptions.

### **2. Skill Demand Forecasting (Machine Learning)**
A simple **Linear Regression model** was used to forecast future skill demand by analyzing skill mentions across three time groups:
- Older postings  
- Mid-range postings  
- Recent postings  

**Key insights:**
- **AI demand projected to rise ~15%** in future periods.  
- **UI/UX shows strong upward trend (~12%).**  
- Traditional skills like **Python, SQL, and Java** show declining trajectories in recent postings.  

This simple model provides a forward-looking view into evolving job-market skill requirements.
